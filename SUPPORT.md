# Support guidelines

## How support is handled
- Public repositories of libraries and non-commercial software (eg. CS-CLIB): Support is handled on the per-repository issues page by the maintainers.
- Public repositories containing commercial software (eg. Launcher): Support is handled through the distributor's (eg. Silverzone) support channel. For Silverzone this channel is cs@silverzonegames.com
- Private and internal repositories containing commercial or internal software or virtual machine images: Support is handled by internal support teams.
- Security support: Handled through reports@security.silverzonegames.com

## Support guidelines for non-professionals
- Always be willing to work with the user
- Make sure to test the reported issue
- Feature requests should be discussed with a maintainer beforehand

### Support for active repositories
- Support is given priority based on issue type, bugs and security patches take precedence over all other support types.
- Documentation is updated on a as-needed basis and documentation issues are give the lowest priority, except on the [Silverzonegames/docs](https://github.com/Silverzonegames/docs) repository.

### Support for repositories that are archived or for versions that are unsupported
- In these cases support is not given priority
